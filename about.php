 The Indian Police Service (IPS) is one of the three All India Services as envisaged in the Constitution of India.[3] It replaced the Indian Imperial Police in 1948, a year after India became independent from the United Kingdom.
Along with the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and the Indian Forest Service (IFS), the IPS is one of the three All India Services[3] — its officers can be employed by both the Union Government and the individual states.
The service commands and provides leadership to state and union territories' police forces, Central Armed Police Forces (BSF, SSB, CRPF, CISF, & ITBP), National Security Guards(NSG), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), National Investigative Agency(NIA), Intelligence Bureau(IB), Research & Analysis Wing(R&AW), Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).
Despite being a very small cadre strength many IPS officers have been awarded highest gallantry awards ( Ashok Chakra, Kirti Chakra ). The present National Security Advisor, India who was an IPS officer was awarded Kirti Chakra for his gallant actions during operation Blue Star. Though generally deployed in supervisory capacity at senior levels it's not uncommon for even a three star general rank IPS officers to be seen on the road taking active part in law and order maintenance. IPS officers have been posted to various UN Missions have been awarded United Nations Medal. Many exceptional IPS officers have been awarded with Padma awards from time to time.
The proposed system will provide an advantage to the users to access the crime reporting portal from anywhere and anytime. The system also provides 100% authentication and encryption in order to protect the identity of the victim and their family. As we are all aware of the pandemic situation, it is very difficult and time consuming to access any public transport. Which makes it nearly impossible for emergency situation victims to reach the nearby police stations or help centres. This website overcomes this particular problem. Also, the probability of loss of important evidence, delay in investigation, inaccessibility to mandatory judiciary place can also be eliminated since the user can take care of all these problems from their home itself. </b><br><br>

<h2 style="color:white"><i>Crime Reporting system in India</i></h2>
<p style="color:white;font-family:Times New Roman; size:100px">
 One of most important area in Crime investigation is efficient way of reporting crime. Till now, crime reporting system in India is online FIR system or manual reporting in Police stations. If any incident happens in any area, then crime reporting can be done via telephone or in person. No actual scene reporting is possible till date. People should be able to seek help in case of emergency on time. A large number of incidents happen in front of people but people are unable to report those incidents to police immediately. India must focus on inculcating an automated system for immediate crime reporting to police surpassing all controllable and uncontrollable factors responsible for unreported crimes. Hence, this paper proposes a smart system that can be implemented for immediate crime reporting to enhance crime reporting which is highly required in today's scenario. </b><br><br>
